## Stack Implementation

### Using the array implementation* of stacks, create a console program that does the following:

1.	Display the following menu:
* [1]	Add Notebook
* [2]	Check Notebook
* [3]	Peek at Notebook
* [4]	Check All
* [5]	Exit

2.	When the user chooses [1], the user will be prompted to enter the name of the notebook’s owner.
3.	When the user chooses [2], a message “[name]’s notebook is being checked”. The notebook is then popped from the stack.
4.	Choosing [3] would display the name of the person who owns the notebook at the top of the stack.
5.	Check all [4] would check all the notebooks and make the stack null.
6.	Keep displaying the menu until the user chooses [5]

*IMPORTANT: Create the stack using your own implementation of arrays. Do not make use of the built in Stack for this. Also do not make use of the built in Arrays class.
