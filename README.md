# Arrays and Linked Lists
## Array: Stack Implementation (Notebook App)
### Using the array implementation* of stacks, create a console program that does the following:

1.	Display the following menu:
* [1]	Add Notebook
* [2]	Check Notebook
* [3]	Peek at Notebook
* [4]	Check All
* [5]	Exit

2.	When the user chooses [1], the user will be prompted to enter the name of the notebook’s owner.
3.	When the user chooses [2], a message “[name]’s notebook is being checked”. The notebook is then popped from the stack.
4.	Choosing [3] would display the name of the person who owns the notebook at the top of the stack.
5.	Check all [4] would check all the notebooks and make the stack null.
6.	Keep displaying the menu until the user chooses [5]

*IMPORTANT: Create the stack using your own implementation of arrays. Do not make use of the built in Stack for this. Also do not make use of the built in Arrays class.

## Queue: Linkedlist Implementation (Doctors Appointment)
### Using the linked list implementation* of queues, create a console program that does the following:

1.	Display the following menu:
* [1]	Sign up for doctor’s consultation
* [2]	Enter room
* [3]	Begin consultation
* [4]	Closing time
* [5]	Exit

2.	When the user chooses [1], the user will be asked to give the name of the person consulting. The user is also the nature of the concern. The person is then enqueued in the list.
3.	When the user chooses [2], the name of the person in front of the queue is displayed on screen. The person, however, is not removed from the list.
4.	When the user chooses [3], name of the person is displayed on the screen along with the nature of concern. After that, the person is removed from the list.
5.	Choosing [4] would free up the whole queue.
6.	Keep displaying the menu until the user chooses [5].

*IMPORTANT: Create your own linked list. Do not make use of the built in lists and queues in C#.
